<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Basic vanilla cake</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
    <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks of butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs. one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
    <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
</ul>
